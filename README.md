> In this project, i will be demonstrating how Kafka Streams fits into the Big Data area and the kinds of capabilities Kafka Streams has which can be considered as the Big pros for Kafka Streams over the other existing technologies in the game like Apache Flink, Hadoop, NiFi and Apache Spark Streaming. The language I will be using is Java and MAVEN as my project build and dependency management tool.

</h1>

## Our data streaming framework that I will be using is <span style="font-size:20px; color:orange; background-color: black">Apache Kafka Streams</span>


**Kafka Streams is available in 2 different APIs:**

1. The Low-Level API: Commonly known as the  <span style="font-size:15px; color:cyan; background-color: black"> Processor API </span> 
2. The High Level API: Where you feel the <span style="font-size:15px; color:cyan; background-color: black"> MAGIC </span>  of Kafka Streams and its <span style="font-size:15px; color:cyan; background-color: black"> POWER </span> 

<span style="border-bottom: 4px solid grey; padding-bottom: 2px"> What is Kafka Streams:<span>

<span style="color:cyan; background-color: black">Kafka Streams </span> is a stream processing library built on top of Apache Kafka, which is one of the top-choice technology when it comes to building data pipelines and and event-driven systems. <span style="color:cyan; background-color: black">Kafka Streams </span> follows the <span style="color:cyan; background-color: black"> KAPPA </span> architecture, processes data as we have any available flowing into our system, it does support <span style="color: orange; background-color: black"> per-event processing </span>ONLY, which a true streaming mechanism, whereas other big data technologies like <span style="background-color: grey; color: darkred">Apache Flink, NiFi, Hadoop and Apache Spark Streaming</span> follow the <span style="color:cyan; background-color: black"> Lambdas</span> architecture, which is kind of <span style="background-color: black"> Hybrid </span>, doing the classic <em><span style="color:orange; background-color: black"> Batch-Processing</span></em> and the <em> <span style="color:orange; background-color: black"> Micro-Batching</span> </em> which is nothing other than grouping batches within a small timespan.
